# Project Inspiration: Task Tracker

The inspiration for the Task Tracker project comes from the everyday need to organize tasks and manage time efficiently. Many people use simple to-do lists—on paper, notes apps, or basic digital tools—to keep track of responsibilities such as homework, work assignments, shopping lists, or personal goals.

While there are many advanced task management applications available, they often include features that are unnecessary for beginners or small personal projects. This project focuses on creating a lightweight, easy-to-use command-line tool that demonstrates core programming concepts without added complexity.

## The Task Tracker was designed to:

- Provide a practical solution to a common problem

- Help beginners understand how programs interact with users

- Demonstrate how data can be stored persistently using files

- Encourage clean program structure and logical flow

- By building this project, developers gain experience with:

- User input and output

- Decision-making logic

- File handling

- Maintaining program state between executions


**Overall, the project bridges the gap between theoretical programming knowledge and real-world application, making it an ideal learning exercise.**
